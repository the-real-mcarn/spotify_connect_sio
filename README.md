# Spotify Connect controller
Controls external Spotify Connect instances on small screen devices like the Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen

## Notice
Because I am not willing to host a webserver for this program, this repro will require you to register an application at Spotify to get a set with your client ID and client secret which you can use to get your access and refresh tokens. 

ONCE THESE KEYS ARE SET DO NO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS APPLICATION AS THESE KEYS ARE STORED AS PLAINTEXT AND THUS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WHO GETS ACCESS TO THEM! 

THIS PROGRAM IS MEANT FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY!
